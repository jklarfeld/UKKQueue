UKKQUEUE 
â€“Updated for Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)
============

A wrapper class around the kqueue file change notification mechanism.

Simply create a UKKQueue (or use the singleton), add a few paths to it and listen to the change notifications via NSWorkspace's notification center.

Installation
-------------

Use cocoapods. It will make life easier.

    pod 'UKKQueue', '~> 0.5'
    $ pod install

This may require to add some additional spec repo to our pods. This can be done through

    $ pod remote add PodSpecs git@github.com:mcb/PodSpecs.git

requires that you clearly mark them as having been modified by you, while

reports about code I wasn't involved in.

I'd also appreciate if you gave credit in your app's about screen or a similar
place. A simple "Thanks to M. Uli Kusterer" is quite sufficient.
Also, I rarely turn down any postcards, gifts, complementary copies of
applications etc.
